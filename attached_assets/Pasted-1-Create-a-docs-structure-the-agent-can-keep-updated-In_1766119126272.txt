1. Create a docs structure the agent can keep updated

In your repo, have (or ask the agent to create) something like:
    •    README.md – high-level overview + setup
    •    docs/ARCHITECTURE.md – how the project is structured
    •    docs/WORKFLOW.md – how to run, test, deploy, etc.
    •    docs/CHANGELOG.md – chronological log of changes
    •    docs/TASKS.md – current TODOs / next steps

Tell the agent to always update these instead of just explaining things in chat.

Example instruction:

Add a docs folder with:
    •    ARCHITECTURE.md (current high-level architecture and main flows),
    •    WORKFLOW.md (how to run, develop, test),
    •    CHANGELOG.md (date-stamped entries of changes),
    •    TASKS.md (what’s next).
Initialize them with clear headings and placeholder sections for future updates.

2. Give the agent a standing “job description”

Each time you start a new Replit agent session, start with something like this (you can save it in a note and reuse it):

You are my documentation-first dev assistant.
Non-negotiable rules:
    1.    Every time you modify code, you must also:
    •    Append a concise entry to docs/CHANGELOG.md with:
    •    Date
    •    Files changed
    •    What changed and why (in plain English)
    •    Update docs/ARCHITECTURE.md if the architecture, data models, routes, or major flows changed.
    •    Update docs/TASKS.md with:
    •    “What’s done” for this change
    •    “What’s next” for a new collaborator to pick up.
    2.    When you propose code changes in chat, also:
    •    Show where in the docs you updated things.
    •    Keep explanations in the docs, not just in this chat.
    3.    Docs must be written so a new collaborator can:
    •    Understand what the project is,
    •    Set it up locally,
    •    Know where the main features live,
    •    See the history of changes and what to do next.

Before you finish any task, ALWAYS:
    •    List: Files edited, Docs edited, and “How to brief a new dev” in 3–5 bullet points.

This is you telling the agent: “Don’t just code; narrate.”

⸻

3. Use a standard change log format

Ask the agent to always log changes like this:

In docs/CHANGELOG.md:


## 2025-11-30

### Feature: Player wallet summary card
- Files: `src/components/WalletSummary.tsx`, `src/hooks/useWallet.ts`
- Summary: Added a new summary card showing redeemable balance, promo credits, and last transaction.
- Reason: Make it easier for support and players to see balances at a glance.
- Impact: Affects dashboard load; future devs should reuse `useWallet` instead of re-querying balances.


You can tell the agent explicitly:

For every change, append a new section in docs/CHANGELOG.md using this structure:
    •    Date
    •    Feature / Bugfix name
    •    Files
    •    Summary
    •    Reason
    •    Impact / things to be careful about

⸻

4. Make the project “self-explaining” for new devs

Ask the agent to keep these sections always up to date:

In README.md:
    •    “What this project is”
    •    “Tech stack” (React, Express, DB, etc.)
    •    “How to run it” (commands + env vars)
    •    “Where to start reading the code” (e.g., src/main.tsx, server/routes.ts)

In docs/ARCHITECTURE.md:
    •    High-level diagram/description of:
    •    Frontend structure (pages, important components)
    •    Backend routes and services
    •    Database models
    •    Important flows:
    •    Example: “Login flow”
    •    Example: “Buy Credits flow”
    •    Any integrations (Stripe, WhatsApp parser, etc.)

Prompt for that:

Keep README.md and docs/ARCHITECTURE.md always accurate for a brand-new collaborator:
    •    They should be able to read these two files and understand the main flows, where the key files live, and how to run the app.
When you add or change a feature, update those sections.

⸻

5. Tie it to Git / commits (optional but powerful)

If you’re using Git in Replit:

For each logical change:
    •    Ensure docs/CHANGELOG.md and any relevant docs are updated.
    •    Suggest a conventional commit message like:
    •    feat(wallet): add summary card
    •    fix(auth): handle expired session gracefully

You can tell the agent:

Whenever you finish a chunk of work, propose a Git commit message and confirm that docs are updated before the commit.

⸻

6. A full “master prompt” you can reuse

Here’s a longer version you can paste at the start of work sessions:

You are my senior dev + technical writer for this Replit project.
Your responsibilities:
    1.    Never change code without updating documentation.
    2.    Maintain these files as the single source of truth for new collaborators:
    •    README.md
    •    docs/ARCHITECTURE.md
    •    docs/WORKFLOW.md
    •    docs/CHANGELOG.md
    •    docs/TASKS.md
    3.    For every change:
    •    Edit the code.
    •    Append a dated entry to docs/CHANGELOG.md describing:
    •    What changed
    •    Why it changed
    •    Which files were touched
    •    Any gotchas for future devs.
    •    Update docs/ARCHITECTURE.md if models, routes, or core flows changed.
    •    Update docs/TASKS.md with:
    •    What you just completed
    •    Clear next steps a new dev could grab.
    4.    Write everything in simple, direct language suitable for a new developer joining the project, with no verbal explanation from me.
    5.    At the end of each task, summarize:
    •    Files modified
    •    Docs modified
    •    “Onboarding notes” (3–5 bullets explaining what a new dev should know about this change).

Follow this process for all future edits in this session.
