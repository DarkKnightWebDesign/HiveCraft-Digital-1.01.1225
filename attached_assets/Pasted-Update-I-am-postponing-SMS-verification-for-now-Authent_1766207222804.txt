Update: I am postponing SMS verification for now.

Authentication requirement (Wix-first):
- The final website will use Wix Studio + Wix Members.
- Use the Wix Members built-in login/signup modal (NOT custom auth screens).
- For V1, rely on Wix email verification + member roles.
- The portal must be built so it works behind member-only pages in Wix Studio.

What to build in this Replit environment:
I still want you to build the full website + portal experience as a reference implementation, BUT treat auth as “Wix Members will handle it.”

So in Replit:
1) Build public marketing pages:
   - Home, Services, Process, Pricing, Contact
2) Build portal pages as if they are protected by login:
   Client Portal:
   - Dashboard (My Projects)
   - Project Detail tabs: Overview / Timeline / Previews / Files / Messages / Billing
   - Previews: view link + comment + approve/reject
   - Messages: per-project thread
   - Files: upload/download
   - Activity/Updates feed
3) Build Staff/Admin portal pages as role-based:
   - Admin Dashboard
   - Project Manager view
   - Designer/Developer work queue
   - Billing view
   - Ability to create projects, update milestones/status, publish previews, message clients, log activity.

Critical deliverable: Wix Studio/Velo Implementation Pack
Provide a step-by-step guide to recreate this in Wix Studio using Wix Members:
- How to enable Wix Members Area + login/signup modal
- How to turn on email verification
- How to set up member roles: Admin, PM, Designer, Developer, Editor, Billing, Client
- Collections schema:
  Projects, Milestones, Tasks, Messages, Previews, Files, ActivityLog, Invoices
- Permission rules:
  Clients can only access records where clientMemberId == currentMemberId
  Staff roles have appropriate access
- Backend web modules (.jsw):
  authzService.jsw, projectService.jsw, messagingService.jsw, previewService.jsw, fileService.jsw
- Page architecture:
  Public pages + Member-only portal pages + Staff-only admin pages
- A test checklist for permissions/security.

Important:
- Do NOT implement SMS verification right now.
- Do NOT implement a custom login modal as the final solution.
- Build the portal experience and document how Wix Members modal will gate access in Wix Studio.
