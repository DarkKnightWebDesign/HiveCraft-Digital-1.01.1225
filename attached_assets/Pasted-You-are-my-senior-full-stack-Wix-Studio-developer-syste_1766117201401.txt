You are my senior full-stack Wix Studio developer + system architect.

Goal:
Build HiveCraft Digital’s website AND a web-based client portal as part of the same Wix Studio project (NOT Wix Editor). Use Wix Studio’s development platform (Velo / Wix Dev Platform) with database collections and backend web modules to power the portal.

Business requirements:
1) Public marketing website for HiveCraft Digital that matches the brand:
   - Dark charcoal base + gold accents, hex/honeycomb motif, subtle glow.
   - Pages: Home, Services, Process, Pricing, Portfolio/Work, About, Contact, Login.
   - Services should include: Managed Websites, Custom Websites, Online Stores, Custom Web Apps.
   - Process is: Discover → Design → Build → Launch → Care (with approval gates).
2) Client Portal (web app) accessible after member login:
   - Clients can see: project status timeline, milestones, tasks, messages, files, preview links, invoices summary, and meeting notes.
   - Clients can upload assets (logos, copy docs, images) and submit feedback on previews.
   - Clients receive notifications inside portal when progress updates occur.
3) Internal Company Back Office (inside Wix as role-based pages only staff can access):
   - Role-based access: Admin, Project Manager, Designer, Developer, Editor, Billing.
   - Staff can: create projects, assign team members, update status, upload previews, post messages, set milestones, request approvals, and log activity.
   - Staff can view client feedback and respond in-thread.
4) Communication:
   - In-portal messaging thread per project, with activity log.
   - Email notifications when key events happen (new message, new preview, approval requested).
5) Security/permissions:
   - Use Wix Members for authentication and role/permissions for staff vs clients.
   - Create and assign custom member roles using Velo where needed.
   - Ensure clients can ONLY access their own project records.
6) Preview system:
   - Staff can publish “Preview” items: URL (staging/preview link), title, description, version tag, created date.
   - Clients can comment + approve/reject a preview.
7) Data model:
   Create Wix Database Collections (with permissions configured):
   - Projects: id, clientMemberId, title, type (Managed Website/Custom Website/Store/App), tier (Launch/Growth/Scale), status, startDate, targetLaunchDate, progressPercent, summary
   - Milestones: projectId, name, status, dueDate, order, approvalRequired (bool)
   - Tasks: projectId, title, assigneeRole, status, dueDate, description
   - Messages: projectId, senderMemberId, senderRole, message, createdAt, attachments[]
   - Previews: projectId, url, label, notes, version, status (draft/ready/approved/rejected), createdAt
   - Files: projectId, uploadedByMemberId, fileUrl, fileType, label, createdAt
   - ActivityLog: projectId, eventType, description, createdAt, actorMemberId
   - Invoices: projectId, invoiceNumber, amount, status, dueDate, url(optional)
8) UI/UX:
   - Portal dashboard: “My Projects” card list, each opens project detail.
   - Project detail tabs: Overview, Timeline, Previews, Files, Messages, Billing.
   - Staff dashboard: filters by status, assigned role, upcoming due dates; quick actions.
   - Must be responsive for desktop + mobile web.

Technical requirements:
- Wix Studio site (not Wix Editor).
- Use Velo backend web modules to keep sensitive logic server-side and call them from the frontend.
- Use Wix Members APIs for current member info and authentication.
- Use proper permission checks in backend.
- Use roles/permissions features; implement role assignment where needed.
- Implement logging and error handling.
- Provide step-by-step Wix Studio setup instructions (collections, permissions, pages, member area, roles).
- Provide the Velo code structure:
  /backend/ web modules (projectService.jsw, messagingService.jsw, previewService.jsw, authzService.jsw)
  /public/ helper modules (uiHelpers.js)
  Page code files for portal pages and admin pages.
- Provide a testing checklist for:
  login, permissions, CRUD, messaging, previews, approvals, email notifications, mobile responsiveness.

Deliverables:
1) A complete Wix Studio site plan (pages + navigation).
2) Database schema definitions + permissions guidance.
3) Velo backend module code and frontend page code (in organized files).
4) Instructions for connecting domain and going live.
5) A short admin user guide: how to create a project, post previews, request approvals.
6) A short client guide: how to review previews and send feedback.

Important:
Do NOT use Wix Editor instructions. Use Wix Studio + Velo / Wix Dev Platform approach only.
If there are multiple possible Wix approaches, choose the simplest reliable one and explain why.
