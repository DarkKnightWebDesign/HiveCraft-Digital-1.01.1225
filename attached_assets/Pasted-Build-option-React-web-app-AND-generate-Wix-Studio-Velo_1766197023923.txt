Build option: “React web app AND generate Wix Studio/Velo transfer documentation alongside it.”

Goal (website first):
Build a browser-based website that includes:
1) Public marketing site (Home, Services, Process, Pricing, Contact)
2) Client Portal (login required)
3) Admin/Staff Portal (role-based access)

Cross-platform requirement (must be built in from day 1):
- The website portal and the future mobile app MUST share the same identity + same backend data.
- If a client uses the web portal now and downloads the mobile app later, they log in with the same email and see the same projects/messages/previews/files/approvals. No migration, no duplicate accounts.

Wix Studio requirement (transferable build):
- Hosting will be Wix Studio, but I do NOT want to build using Wix drag-and-drop.
- I want a custom portal experience that can be reproduced in Wix Studio using Velo (Collections + Member Roles + backend web modules .jsw).
- Your output must include a “Wix Studio Implementation Pack”:
  - Collection schemas + permissions
  - Member role definitions (Admin, PM, Designer, Developer, Editor, Billing, Client)
  - Backend web modules: authzService.jsw, projectService.jsw, messagingService.jsw, previewService.jsw, fileService.jsw
  - Page architecture (public pages + member pages + staff-only pages)
  - Step-by-step checklist to recreate the same portal in Wix Studio

Website portal features (must exist in web version):
Client Portal:
- Dashboard: My Projects list
- Project Detail tabs: Overview / Timeline / Previews / Files / Messages / Billing
- Previews: view link, comment, approve/reject
- Messaging: per-project thread with attachments
- Files: upload/download assets
- Updates: clients can see status and activity log

Admin/Staff Portal:
- Create projects, assign staff, update milestones/status, publish previews, message clients, log activity
- Role-based access controls

Security requirement:
- Provide a permissions matrix + test plan so clients can ONLY access records where clientMemberId == their member id.

Build approach inside Replit:
- Implement the full UI + routes now (React)
- Use a simple backend (Node/Express + SQLite or JSON) for the prototype
- BUT document the 1:1 mapping to Wix Velo Collections + .jsw backend modules so it can be transferred.
