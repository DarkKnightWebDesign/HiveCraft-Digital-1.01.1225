Build the React web app AND generate Wix Studio/Velo transfer documentation alongside it.

My intent:
1) Website first (browser-based). This web app must include:
   - Public marketing site
   - Client portal (member login)
   - Admin/staff portal (role-based)
2) Later we will build a native mobile app, but the website must be built with a “single source of truth” backend model so the mobile app can use the same data and accounts.

Critical requirement: Cross-platform consistency
- The web portal and future mobile app must share the same user identity and the same backend data.
- If a client uses the web portal first, then later installs the app, they log in with the same email and see the same projects, messages, previews, files, approvals, history. No migration, no duplicate accounts.

Wix requirements (transfer to Wix Studio):
- I want hosting on Wix Studio, but I do NOT want to build the site in Wix drag-and-drop.
- I want a custom-built portal experience that can be transferred to Wix using Wix Dev tools (Velo + Wix Apps + Wix CLI where appropriate).
- Output must include a “Wix Studio Implementation Pack”: database collection schemas, permissions matrix, backend web modules (.jsw), page wiring notes, and a step-by-step checklist to reproduce the same portal inside Wix Studio.

In THIS Replit environment, build:
A) A working React web app prototype (marketing + client portal + admin portal) with:
   - Auth screens, role routing, dashboards, project detail pages, previews, messaging, file upload UI, approvals.
   - A clean HiveCraft theme (dark charcoal + gold accents, hex/honeycomb motif).
B) In parallel, produce Wix Studio/Velo equivalents:
   - Collections: Projects, Milestones, Tasks, Messages, Previews, Files, ActivityLog, Invoices
   - Permission rules ensuring clients only access their own records (clientMemberId == currentMemberId)
   - Backend web modules: authzService.jsw, projectService.jsw, messagingService.jsw, previewService.jsw, fileService.jsw
   - Page architecture: public pages + members area + staff-only pages
   - Roles: Admin, PM, Designer, Developer, Editor, Billing

Important:
- Do not build something that only works in React. The goal is a React prototype PLUS an explicit, detailed Wix Studio transfer blueprint so I can move it to Wix and host there.
- Assume I will upload brand/logo mockups. Provide placeholders and a clear asset folder structure now.
